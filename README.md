The Cryptic Riddle Challenge üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You have stumbled upon an ancient scroll containing a cryptic riddle left by a mysterious sage. The riddle reads:

In shadows deep, secrets keep,
Locked away from prying eyes.
Through ciphered code, the truth shall seep,
Unravel the mystery, and claim your prize.

With the key I provide, decrypt the text,
And reveal the message, long kept in jest.
But heed my warning, lest you perplex,
For only the wise shall pass this test.

Your Task:

Your task is to use the API to decrypt the encrypted text and unveil the hidden message. The API will provide you with both the encrypted text and the key needed for decryption.

**Encrypted Message:** Will be returned by the API

**Key:** Will be returned by the API

**Hints:**

Dive deep into the realm of cryptography, where each letter holds a secret waiting to be unveiled.
Explore different cryptographic techniques and apply your knowledge to decipher the message.
Look for patterns in the encrypted text and consider the significance of repeating sequences. Sometimes, the key to unlocking the cipher lies in the repetition.
